## Repositories
* [Autofac](https://github.com/autofac/Autofac) - Autofac is an IoC container for Microsoft .NET. It manages the dependencies between classes so that applications stay easy to change as they grow in size and complexity. This is achieved by treating regular .NET classes as components.
* [Ninject](https://github.com/ninject/Ninject) - Ninject is a lightning-fast, ultra-lightweight dependency injector for .NET applications. It helps you split your application into a collection of loosely-coupled, highly-cohesive pieces, and then glue them back together in a flexible manner.
* [DryIoc](https://github.com/dadhi/DryIoc) - DryIoc is fast, small, full-featured IoC Container for .NET
* [Jab](https://github.com/pakrym/jab) - C# Source Generator based dependency injection container implementation.
* [stronginject](https://github.com/YairHalberstadt/stronginject) - compile time dependency injection for .NET
* [Scrutor](https://github.com/khellang/Scrutor) - Assembly scanning and decoration extensions for Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
* [Reflex](https://github.com/gustavopsantos/Reflex) - Reflex is an Dependency Injection framework for Unity. Making your classes independent of its dependencies, granting better separation of concerns. 
* [Pure.DI](https://github.com/DevTeam/Pure.DI) - Pure.DI is not a framework or library, but a source code generator for creating object graphs. To make them accurate, the developer uses a set of intuitive hints from the Pure.DI API. 
* [AutoMocker](https://github.com/moq/Moq.AutoMocker) - An automocking container for Moq. Use this if you're invested in your IoC container and want to decouple your unit tests from changes to their constructor arguments.
* [Xunit.DependencyInjection](https://github.com/pengweiqhca/Xunit.DependencyInjection) - Use Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection to resolve xUnit test cases
